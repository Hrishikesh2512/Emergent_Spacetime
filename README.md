# Emergent_Spacetime

**Emergent_Spacetime** explores a minimal causal model in which time, distance,
light-cone structure, and curvature-like effects arise from causal relationships
alone, without assuming spacetime as a fundamental entity.

The project is intended as a conceptual toy model for exploring emergent
spacetime and gravity-like behavior.

## Overview

This repository contains an interactive Python simulation that builds a
"toy universe" using only causal rules. Spacetime is not assumed at the
fundamental level; instead, familiar geometric features emerge from
bounded causal interactions and energy-biased connectivity.

The model is exploratory and educational in nature, designed to provide
intuition into modern ideas about emergent geometry and gravity.
